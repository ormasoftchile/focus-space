![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.0.1-green)

## üéØ Goals & Purpose

Focus Space solves the common problem of **context switching overhead** in large codebases. Instead of constantly scrolling through the Explorer or losing track of important files, Focus Space provides:

- **Curated File Management**: Keep only the files you're actively working on in a dedicated panel
- **Enhanced GitHub Copilot Integration**: Send focused context directly to Copilot Chat for better AI assistance
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Eliminate distractions and maintain focus on your current task
- **Improved Collaboration**: Share your focus context with team members

## ‚ú® What Focus Space Does

### üìÅ **Smart File Curation**
- Add files and folders to your Focus Space via context menus, drag & drop, or commands
- **Auto-hide when empty** - the panel only appears when you have focused items
- **Active file reveal** - automatically highlights your current file in Focus Space instead of Explorer

### üóÇÔ∏è **Intelligent Organization**
- **Virtual Sections**: Create logical groupings like "Current Feature", "Bug Fixes", or "Dependencies"
- **Drag & Drop Reordering**: Organize your focus items exactly how you need them
- **Folder Auto-Conversion**: Folders automatically become sections when you add children

### ü§ñ **GitHub Copilot Integration**
- **Send to Copilot Chat**: Right-click any file or section to send content directly to Copilot
- **Batch Operations**: Send entire sections with multiple files for comprehensive context
- **Smart Content Formatting**: Automatically formats code with syntax highlighting and file information

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Comprehensive Configuration**
- **20+ Settings** across Appearance, Behavior, Performance, and Workflow categories
- **Exclude Patterns**: Filter out unwanted files with glob pattern support
- **Customizable Behavior**: Configure reveal behavior, drag & drop preferences, and more
- **Migration System**: Seamless updates with backward compatibility

### üîÑ **File System Integration**
- **Auto-sync**: Automatically updates when files are moved, renamed, or deleted
- **Cross-workspace**: Maintain separate focus contexts for different projects
- **Persistent State**: Your focus items are saved and restored between sessions
