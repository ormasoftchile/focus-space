## üéØ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** (v8 or higher)
- **VS Code** (latest version recommended)
- **Git** for version control

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/focus-space.git
   cd focus-space
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Open in VS Code**:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

5. **Start development**:
   - Press `F5` to launch the Extension Development Host
   - Make your changes and test them in the development environment

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Code Structure

- `src/` - Main source code
  - `extension.ts` - Extension entry point
  - `managers/` - Core business logic
  - `providers/` - VS Code tree data providers
  - `controllers/` - UI interaction handlers
  - `utils/` - Shared utilities and helpers
  - `models/` - Data models and interfaces
  - `test/` - Comprehensive test suite

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Compile TypeScript
npm run compile

# Run all tests
npm test

# Watch mode for development
npm run watch

# Package extension
vsce package
```

### Code Quality

We maintain high code quality standards:

- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed code throughout
- **ESLint**: Code linting with our configuration
- **Testing**: 250+ tests with comprehensive coverage
- **Documentation**: Clear comments and documentation

## üìù How to Contribute

### 1. Issues and Bug Reports

- **Search existing issues** before creating new ones
- **Use issue templates** when available
- **Provide detailed information**:
  - VS Code version
  - Extension version
  - Operating system
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs actual behavior

### 2. Feature Requests

- **Check the roadmap** in `docs/focus-space-design.md`
- **Discuss large features** in issues before implementing
- **Follow the incremental development approach**

### 3. Pull Requests

#### Before You Start
- **Create an issue** to discuss your changes
- **Check existing PRs** to avoid duplication
- **Review the codebase** to understand patterns

#### PR Guidelines
- **Fork and branch**: Create a feature branch from `main`
- **Descriptive names**: Use clear branch names like `feature/keyboard-shortcuts`
- **Small, focused changes**: One feature or fix per PR
- **Tests included**: Add tests for new functionality
- **Documentation**: Update docs if needed

#### PR Process
1. **Create your branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Follow existing code patterns
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test thoroughly**:
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   npm test
   ```

4. **Commit with clear messages**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add keyboard shortcuts for focus management"
   ```

5. **Push and create PR**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests
```bash
# All tests
npm test

# Specific test file
npm test -- --grep "ConfigurationManager"

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Writing Tests
- **Unit tests** for all new functionality
- **Integration tests** for complex interactions
- **Edge case testing** for robust error handling
- **Performance tests** for optimization features

### Test Structure
```typescript
suite('Feature Name', () => {
    setup(() => {
        // Test setup
    });
    
    teardown(() => {
        // Cleanup
    });
    
    test('Should do something specific', () => {
        // Test implementation
    });
});
```

## üìä Development Process

### Incremental Development

Focus Space follows an incremental development approach:

1. **Review current increment** in `docs/focus-space-design.md`
2. **Plan your changes** to fit the architecture
3. **Implement in small, testable chunks**
4. **Complete testing before moving on**

### Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Use strict type checking
- **Naming**: Clear, descriptive names for variables and functions
- **Comments**: Document complex logic and public APIs
- **Formatting**: Let ESLint handle formatting

### Architecture Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class/module has one clear purpose
- **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript's type system
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user feedback
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications of changes

## üîÑ Release Process

We follow semantic versioning (SemVer):

- **MAJOR** version: Breaking changes
- **MINOR** version: New features (backward compatible)
