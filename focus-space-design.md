# Focus Space Extension - Design Summary

## Purpose
A VS Code extension that adds a dedicated "Focus Space" panel to the Explorer, allowing developers to curate a custom list of files and folders they're actively working on, improving focus and streamlining collaboration with GitHub Copilot.

## Core Components

### 1. **Focus Space TreeView**
- Custom tree view in Explorer sidebar
- **Auto-hide when empty** - appears only after first item added
- Displays user-curated list of files, folders, and virtual sections
- Visual separation from regular file explorer
- Supports drag & drop reordering and grouping

### 2. **Data Model**
```typescript
interface FocusEntry {
  id: string;
  uri: vscode.Uri;
  type: 'file' | 'folder' | 'section';
  label?: string;
  children?: FocusEntry[];
  metadata?: {
    dateAdded: number;
    relativePath: string;
  };
}
```

### 3. **Entry Points**
- Explorer context menu: "Add to Focus Space"
- Editor title menu: "Add to Focus Space"
- Command palette commands
- Drag & drop from Explorer

### 4. **Management Features**
- Create virtual sections for logical grouping
- Remove items individually or clear all
- Reveal focused items in Explorer
- Reorder via drag & drop
- **Auto-show on first addition, hide when empty**

### 5. **Active File Reveal**
- **Smart reveal behavior**: When file in Focus Space becomes active, reveal it there instead of Explorer
- **Configurable settings**:
  - `focus-space-only`: Only reveal in Focus Space
  - `both`: Reveal in both locations
  - `smart` (default): Reveal in Focus Space if present, Explorer otherwise
- **Visual indicators**: Highlight active file with accent color
- **Reduces scrolling**: Keeps focus context visible

### 6. **Copilot Integration**
- Context menu: "Send to Copilot Chat"
- Drag focused items directly into Chat view
- Batch send sections or multiple selections

### 7. **Persistence**
- Workspace-level: `.vscode/focus-space.json`
- Global state for cross-workspace lists
- Auto-sync on changes with debouncing

### 8. **Visibility Control**
- Hidden by default when empty (no visual clutter)
- Auto-appears on first item addition
- Configuration option: `focusSpace.hideWhenEmpty`
- Context tracking: `focusSpace.hasItems`

## Technical Implementation
- **TreeDataProvider**: Manages focus list display
- **DragAndDropController**: Handles D&D operations
- **FocusSpaceManager**: Central state management with visibility control
- **FileSystemWatcher**: Track file moves/deletions
- **ActiveEditorTracker**: Intercept and redirect file reveals
- **Commands**: Add, remove, organize, send to chat
- **When clause contexts**: Control view visibility

## User Workflow
1. Right-click file/folder in Explorer → "Add to Focus Space"
2. Focus Space appears automatically with first item
3. Organize into logical sections via drag & drop
4. Opening focused files reveals them in Focus Space (not deep in Explorer)
5. Drag items to Copilot Chat for focused assistance
6. Stay in focus context without Explorer scrolling
7. Focus Space auto-hides when last item removed

## Configuration
```json
{
  "focusSpace.hideWhenEmpty": true,
  "focusSpace.revealBehavior": "smart",
  "focusSpace.persistenceLocation": "workspace"
}
```

## Implementation Plan Methodology

### **Increment Structure**
Each increment should be:
- **Well-scoped**: Single responsibility (data model OR UI OR commands, not mixed)
- **Coherent**: All parts of the increment work together logically
- **Testable**: Can be validated in isolation with unit tests
- **Dependency-aware**: Built in logical order (foundation → features)

### **Testing Approach**
- **Microsoft's official stack**: @vscode/test-electron + Mocha
- **Unit tests per increment**: Each increment includes its own test suite
- **Real VS Code environment**: Tests run in actual VS Code instance for full API access

### **Granularity**
- **Separate increments** for distinct features (drag/drop separate from context menus)
- **Single responsibility** per increment to maintain coherence

### **Validation Process**
Each increment includes:
- **Clear deliverables**: What exactly gets built
- **Unit test suite**: Automated tests using @vscode/test-electron + Mocha
- **Manual test checklist**: Specific things you manually verify
- **Acceptance criteria**: When to consider it "done"
- **Dependencies**: What must exist before starting

### **Bug Handling**
- **Immediate fix**: Stop current work to fix any discovered bug
- **Regression prevention**: Add unit tests after each fix using Microsoft's testing framework
- **No debt accumulation**: Don't move to next increment with known issues

### **Example Increment Structure**
```
Increment 3: Basic TreeView Display
Dependencies: [Increment 1: Data Models, Increment 2: Extension Skeleton]
Scope: Visual rendering only (no interactions)
Deliverables:
- TreeDataProvider implementation
- Basic tree item rendering
- Focus Space view registration
Unit Tests:
- TreeDataProvider.test.ts (getChildren, getTreeItem)
- Extension activation tests
Manual Test Checklist:
□ Focus Space appears in Explorer
□ Shows placeholder when empty
□ Displays sample data correctly
□ Icons render properly
Acceptance: View shows, renders without errors, all tests pass
```

└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Icon Design

### Focus Target Icon Options

**Option 1: Custom SVG Icon**
```svg
<!-- focus-target.svg -->
<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none">
  <circle cx="8" cy="8" r="6" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" fill="none"/>
  <circle cx="8" cy="8" r="2" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" fill="none"/>
  <line x1="2" y1="8" x2="4" y2="8" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5"/>
  <line x1="12" y1="8" x2="14" y2="8" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5"/>
  <line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5"/>
  <line x1="8" y1="12" x2="8" y2="14" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5"/>
</svg>
```

**Option 2: VS Code Built-in Icons**
- `$(target)` - Basic target icon (MVP choice)
- `$(zoom-in)` - Magnifying glass with plus
- `$(search-focus)` - Search with focus ring
- `$(circle-large-outline)` - Large circle outline

**Implementation in package.json:**
```json
{
  "contributes": {
    "icons": {
      "focus-target": {
        "description": "Focus target icon",
        "default": {
          "fontPath": "./resources/focus-target.svg",
          "fontCharacter": "\\E001"
        }
      }
    },
    "views": {
      "explorer": [
        {
          "id": "focusSpace",
          "name": "Focus Space",
          "icon": "$(focus-target)",
          "contextualTitle": "Focus Space"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Strategy:**
- **MVP**: Use `$(target)` built-in icon
- **Final**: Create custom SVG for professional camera focus appearance

## Buffer Management

### 9. **Close Non-Focus Buffers**
A powerful productivity feature to manage editor buffer clutter by closing all open editor tabs that are not included in the current Focus Space.

**Command**: `focusSpace.closeNonFocusBuffers`
- **Action**: Closes all open editor tabs/buffers except those that exist in Focus Space
- **Smart behavior**: Preserves unsaved files (prompts for save if needed)
- **Scope**: Only affects current editor group or all groups (configurable)
- **Confirmation**: Optional confirmation dialog for safety

**Use Case**:
During development sessions, many editor buffers accumulate from navigation, searches, and exploration. This feature allows developers to quickly return to a clean state focused only on their curated files, reducing cognitive load and improving focus.

**Configuration Options**:
```json
{
  "focusSpace.closeNonFocusBuffers.confirmBeforeClose": true,
  "focusSpace.closeNonFocusBuffers.preserveUnsaved": true,
  "focusSpace.closeNonFocusBuffers.scope": "currentGroup" // "currentGroup" | "allGroups"
}
```

**Implementation**:
- Access via command palette: "Focus Space: Close Non-Focus Buffers"
- Optional toolbar button in Focus Space view
- Keyboard shortcut: `Cmd+K Cmd+F` (or configurable)
- Integration with VS Code's `workbench.action.closeOtherEditors` API

**Core Commands:** Successfully implemented complete removal and management system with `removeFromFocusSpace`, `removeAll`, and `revealInExplorer` commands. Added comprehensive context menus for Focus Space tree view items with proper when clause filtering.

**Folder Display & Auto-Conversion:** Implemented revolutionary hybrid folder system:
- **Phase 1 (Hybrid View)**: Folders show actual file system contents as temporary entries
- **Phase 2 (Auto-Conversion)**: When user tries to modify folder children, system automatically converts folder structure to editable sections
- **Benefits**: Preserves file system structure until editing is needed, then provides full management control

**Auto-Conversion Architecture:**
- `FocusSpaceManager.autoConvertFolderToSection()`: Core conversion method that transforms folder structure to section hierarchy
- Enhanced `removeFromFocusSpaceCommand`: Detects folder child operations and triggers seamless conversion
- **User Experience**: "Remove item from folder" → Auto-convert → Remove specific item → Continue with full editing control
- **Graceful Handling**: Properly handles non-existent folders and error conditions

**Context Menu Intelligence:** Folder children show "Remove from Focus Space" which intelligently:
1. Prompts user with clear explanation of conversion
2. Auto-converts folder to section with all contents
3. Removes the specific requested item
4. Leaves user with fully editable section structure

**Section Cleanup Enhancement:** Fixed bug where removing sections left orphaned child entries by implementing proper cascade deletion in `FocusSpaceManager.removeEntry()`.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/managers/focusSpaceManager.ts`: Added `autoConvertFolderToSection()` method for seamless folder-to-section transformation

When dragging an item to a destination where an identical item already exists:
- **Primary Strategy**: Prevent operation with modal dialog
- **User Options**: Cancel / Replace Existing / Keep Both (auto-rename)
- **Edge Cases**: Self-drop (ignore), parent-to-child (prevent), cross-workspace (allow)
- **Implementation**: Use `vscode.window.showWarningMessage` for consistency with VS Code patterns

#### Unit Tests:
- ✅ `dragDrop.test.ts`: Controller logic, state updates, conflict resolution
- ✅ `reorder.test.ts`: Position calculations

#### Manual Test Checklist:
- ✅ Drag items to reorder within same container
- ✅ Drop into sections (cross-section moves)
- ✅ Visual feedback shows drop zones (handled by VS Code)
- ✅ State updates correctly after drag operations
- ✅ Conflict detection and prevention works correctly
- ✅ Position calculations maintain order integrity

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- ✅ Smooth drag & drop experience through VS Code TreeDragAndDropController
- ✅ State updates correctly with proper event firing
- ✅ No data loss during operations (comprehensive conflict resolution)
- ✅ Position control is precise for both reordering and moving

#### Implementation Summary:
**Conflict Resolution Strategy**: Prevent-with-dialog approach providing Cancel/Replace/Keep Both options, ensuring data safety and user control over duplicate scenarios.

  id: string;
  uri: vscode.Uri;
  type: 'file' | 'folder' | 'section';
  label?: string;
  isExpanded?: boolean;  // UI state
  children?: FocusEntry[];  // Always present, populated on-demand
  metadata?: {
    dateAdded: number;
    relativePath: string;
